# STM32_Development Sandbox
---
This repo is used to store the code for my experimentation and learning of the STM32 F446RE DevBoard. 

Some of the code, namely the firmware and linker code, is adapted from the [bare metal programming guide](https://github.com/cpq/bare-metal-programming-guide?tab=readme-ov-file) written by cpq, which is covered under the MIT license.

As I progress, I hope to adapt my MCU to operate my robotic arm, based completely on the from-scratch firmware and code I have written, and not libraries.
